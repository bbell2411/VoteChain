# 🗳️ VoteChain — Decentralized Voting dApp

**VoteChain** is a Web3 application built with **React** and **Ethers.js** that enables users to connect their Ethereum wallet, view voting proposals, and cast votes securely on the blockchain.  

This project demonstrates practical skills in frontend React development combined with blockchain interaction fundamentals, serving as a foundation for a fully decentralized governance system.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Connect your Ethereum wallet via MetaMask  
- 📋 Display a list of voting proposals  
- ✅ Allow users to vote once per proposal  
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI with dark mode styling  
- ⚙️ Uses Ethers.js for wallet connection and blockchain interaction  

---

## 💡 Current Status

- Proposals and votes are currently managed locally in React state for rapid development and UI testing  
- Solidity smart contract developed for managing proposals and votes on-chain (contract code included in `/contracts` folder)  
- Integration with deployed smart contract on testnet is underway  
- Transactional interactions (adding proposals, voting) planned to be fully on-chain with ETH gas costs  

---

## 📦 Technology Stack

- React (Vite) for frontend UI  
- Ethers.js (v6) for Ethereum blockchain interaction  
- Solidity (v0.8.28) for smart contract development  
- CSS3 with custom dark mode design  

---

## 🛠️ Roadmap

- [ ] Enhance UI/UX and add accessibility features

## 📚 Learning Goals

This project is part of my journey to become proficient in Web3 development by:  
- Building a full-stack dApp integrating frontend React with Ethereum smart contracts  
- Gaining hands-on experience with wallet connectivity, blockchain reads/writes, and gas management  
- Understanding decentralized governance mechanisms and how to implement them
